In Intellij, i can directly clone project using file < new < project from version control.

I can also use fetch it's in the branch name right next to our project name.

I can see branches and i have two or more branches i can choose in which i want to commit and push.

So, Git PULL is nothing but git fetch + merge request.

Git fetch - fetches the changes into local repository and then you can merge it in main branch by merge.

Git pull - directly makes the changes in the code.
         - make changes and select from where you want to pull.
